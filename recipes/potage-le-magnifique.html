        This Breton dish is one of many made famous in the recipe collection Uncommon Taste, written by the
        ever-mysterious Gourmet. Its popularity is no mystery, however, as its rich texture and deceptive simplicity
        showcase a hearty soup that pairs perfectly with toasted bread and cheese. The only danger is that it may make
        you weep with joy...

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 stick unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 or 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced and peeled medium carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, then add the onion and garlic. Cook until soft and
                fragrant, about 3 to 5 minutes, then add the diced carrots, stirring to coat with butter.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sprinkle the flour into the pan and stir to be sure there are no clumps remaining. Add the chicken and beef
                broth, and cook until the carrots are soft, about 15 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender (or in batches in
                a regular blender) until it has a nice, thick consistency, adding with extra broth if needed to get your
                preferred consistency Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
