        Donâ€™t let anyone steal your sweetroll ever again. Instead of guarding your
        hard-won baked goods against bandits and that pesky Thieves Guild, now you
        can bake them in the quiet safety of your own home with no one the wiser.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Rolls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup warm whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Rolls</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. In a large bowl, combine the butter, warm milk, and honey, stirring until the
                honey has dissolved. Add the salt and yeast, followed by the egg and flour, and mix completely until you have a
                smooth batter. Spoon evenly into four 5-inch miniature Bundt pans. Allow to rise for just 30 minutes, then bake
                for 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the rolls comes out clean.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Frosting</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>While the rolls bake, cream together the cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar in a small bowl. Gradually add
                just enough heavy cream to get a smooth, thick icing that barely runs off a spoon.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the rolls are finished baking, allow to cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then tip out onto a cooling rack.
                When they are completely cooled, spoon the icing over the tops of the rolls, letting it run down the sides a
                little.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
